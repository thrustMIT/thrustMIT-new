          content: `Rocketry is the science and technology of rocket design, construction, and flight. A rocket is a vehicle that obtains thrust from a rocket engine through the expulsion of reaction mass at high speed.
The fundamental principle behind rocket propulsion is Newton's Third Law of Motion: for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When a rocket expels mass out of its nozzle at high velocity, it experiences an equal and opposite force that propels it forward.

Rockets are unique among propulsion systems because they carry both fuel and oxidizer, allowing them to operate in the vacuum of space where no atmospheric oxygen is available.`

          title: 'History of Rocketry',
          content: `The history of rocketry dates back to ancient China, where gunpowder-filled tubes were used as weapons and fireworks around the 13th century. However, modern rocketry began in the early 20th century with pioneers like Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Robert Goddard, and Hermann Oberth.

Robert Goddard launched the first liquid-fueled rocket in 1926, marking a major milestone. The V-2 rocket developed during World War II became the first artificial object to reach space in 1944.

The Space Age began with the launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957, followed by Yuri Gagarin's historic spaceflight in 1961 and the Apollo moon landings from 1969-1972. Today, rocketry continues to advance with reusable rockets and ambitious missions to Mars and beyond.`

          content: `Rockets can be classified based on their propulsion systems:

**Solid Rockets**: Use a solid propellant mixture that burns continuously once ignited. Simple and reliable, but cannot be throttled or shut down once started. Commonly used in boosters and military applications.

**Liquid Rockets**: Use separate liquid fuel and oxidizer that are mixed in the combustion chamber. Offer precise throttle control and can be shut down and restarted. More complex but provide better performance.

**Hybrid Rockets**: Combine solid fuel with liquid or gaseous oxidizer. Offer benefits of both systems with improved safety and throttle capability.

**Electric Propulsion**: Use electrical energy to accelerate propellant to high speeds. Very efficient but provide low thrust. Used for spacecraft maneuvering and deep space missions.`

          content: `Rocket propulsion is governed by the principle of momentum conservation. The thrust equation describes the force generated:

F = ṁ * Ve + (Pe - Pa) * Ae

Where:
- F is thrust
- ṁ is mass flow rate
- Ve is exhaust velocity
- Pe is exit pressure
- Pa is ambient pressure
- Ae is nozzle exit area

The specific impulse (Isp) is a key performance metric measuring the efficiency of a rocket engine. It represents the thrust produced per unit weight of propellant consumed per second.`

          content: `The combustion process in rocket engines involves the rapid chemical reaction between fuel and oxidizer in the combustion chamber. This reaction releases tremendous amounts of energy in the form of heat, creating high-temperature, high-pressure gases.

Key factors affecting combustion:
- **Mixture Ratio**: The proportion of oxidizer to fuel
- **Chamber Pressure**: Higher pressures improve performance
- **Temperature**: Combustion temperatures can exceed 3000°C
- **Residence Time**: Duration reactants spend in chamber

The combustion products are then accelerated through a converging-diverging nozzle, converting thermal energy into kinetic energy and producing thrust.`

          id: 'nozzles',
          title: 'Rocket Nozzles',
          content: `The rocket nozzle is a critical component that converts high-pressure, high-temperature gases into high-velocity exhaust. Most rocket nozzles use a converging-diverging design (de Laval nozzle).

**Nozzle Sections**:
- **Convergent Section**: Accelerates flow to sonic velocity at the throat
- **Throat**: Minimum area where flow reaches Mach 1
- **Divergent Section**: Further accelerates flow to supersonic speeds

The nozzle expansion ratio (exit area to throat area) is optimized for the operating altitude. Overexpanded or underexpanded nozzles lose efficiency. Advanced designs include:
- Bell nozzles (most common)
- Aerospike nozzles (altitude-compensating)
- Plug nozzles (compact design)`

          content: `Rocket stability is crucial for successful flight. A stable rocket naturally corrects itself when disturbed, while an unstable rocket will tumble out of control.

**Center of Gravity (CG)**: The point where the rocket's weight is balanced. It moves aft as propellant is consumed.

**Center of Pressure (CP)**: The point where aerodynamic forces act. It's determined by the rocket's external shape.

**Stability Margin**: For passive stability, the CP must be behind the CG by at least one rocket diameter (caliber). This ensures corrective moments when the rocket tilts.

Factors affecting stability:
- Fin size and placement
- Nose cone shape
- Body tube length
- Mass distribution`

          content: `Drag is the aerodynamic force opposing a rocket's motion through the atmosphere. It depends on velocity, air density, and the rocket's shape.

**Types of Drag**:

**Skin Friction Drag**: Caused by air viscosity along the rocket's surface. Reduced with smooth finishes.

**Pressure Drag (Form Drag)**: Results from pressure differences around the rocket body. Minimized with streamlined shapes.

**Base Drag**: Caused by low pressure at the rocket's base. Can be significant at transonic speeds.

**Wave Drag**: Occurs at supersonic speeds due to shock waves. Managed through proper nose cone design.

The drag coefficient (Cd) quantifies drag efficiency. Lower Cd values indicate better aerodynamic performance. Typical model rockets have Cd values between 0.4-0.8.`

**1. Launch Phase**: Maximum acceleration as the rocket lifts off. Structural loads are highest during this phase.

**2. Powered Flight**: The rocket accelerates while the motor burns. Experiences maximum dynamic pressure (Max-Q) partway through this phase.

**3. Coast Phase**: After burnout, the rocket coasts upward on momentum alone. Continues to decelerate due to gravity and drag.

**4. Apogee**: The highest point of flight where vertical velocity becomes zero. Ideal moment for recovery deployment.

**5. Recovery Descent**: Parachute or other recovery system deploys, slowing the rocket's descent to a safe landing speed.

**6. Landing**: Touchdown at terminal velocity under parachute. Proper recovery ensures the rocket can be flown again.`
